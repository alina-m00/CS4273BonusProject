# CS4273BonusProject
Bonus Project:

We crafted a foundational calculator using the Python programming language,implementing all functionalities 
and stylistic elements within Python.The calculator's development harnessed the capabilities of the "tkinter" library.

Description:
This calculator excels in performing basic arithmetic operations, encompassing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features dedicated buttons, 
labeled as C (clear) and AC (clear all), facilitating the removal of input data. Notably, both input and output are confined to a maximum of 8 digits. 
Should a division by zero occur, a clear message, "Division by 0 Not Allowed," will be prominently displayed.
